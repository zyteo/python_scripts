## I'm lazy so I get python to do it for me.

#### 1. Categorise.py
Script reads an excel file (categorise_sample.xlsx) with columns. Takes the item and cost, and sums up each category. Results produced in output file. For budgeting.

#### 2. Filter.py
Script reads a txt file that was converted by OCR (https://www.ocr2edit.com) and filters out and sums up transport spending and then prints it out. For filtering transaction statement.
